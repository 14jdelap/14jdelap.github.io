An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator… Are you getting it?”\nThe iPhone — and all succeeding smartphones — collapsed all devices into 1.

No wonder why older people struggle with new technology (which usually involve screens) but can still solve problems by talking.\nMy former teacher, the inspiring Javier Cañada, recently spoke about why he thinks voice is the best interface. Some of his arguments include:\nVoice is inmaterial and doesn’t take space, unlike pixels on a screen Voice frees up the senses as you don’t need to use multiple senses simultaneously (unlike sight and gesture with graphical interfaces) Voice is the most accessible interface, you just need to be able to speak Voice has emotiveness because it has intonation Voice has personality, how each of us speaks is unique While the uptick of voice assistants, like Alexa and Siri, have made voice a more prominent interface to interact with electronic products they’re still notoriously insufficient to be anywhere near a complete replacement.\nAI-powered voice agents will undermine the smartphone supremacy How will this change the inernet economy? Open questions Ideas Voice as the new interface Fast AI models enable a new (but also old interface: voice) Voice is our oldest interface: about 200,000 years old Voice has a wide throughput, expresses emotions, more personal (escuchar lo de Javier) Biggest blockers: unintelligent assistants, now slow LLM models.
