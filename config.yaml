      I'm a software engineer at [Thought Machine's](https://thoughtmachine.net) Developer Platform unit, where I'm focused on Python tooling, how our monorepo compiles and links, and improving the user experience of our tools.

      I also built [Horus](https://tryhorus.com), a full-stack observability system for distributed microservices.

      My current interests include:

      - How will technology reshape around voice as an interface? [Some hypotheses here](https://josedelapuente.com/posts/ais-iphone-moment/)
      - Python and Linux internals
      - Learning about biology and chemistry
