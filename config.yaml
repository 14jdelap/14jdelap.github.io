      I'm a software engineer at [Thought Machine's](https://thoughtmachine.net) Scheduling team, where I work on a high-throughput event processing pipeline. Before that, I was at [Snyk's](https://snyk.io) API infrastructure team.

      I recently built [Horus](https://tryhorus.com), a full-stack observability system for distributed microservices.
