      I'm a software engineer at [Thought Machine's](https://thoughtmachine.net) DevEx team, where I'm currently focused on working with our Please build system to compile C and Python. I've also worked on distributed systems (Go, gRPC and HTTP APIs, Postgres, Docker, K8s).

      I recently built [Horus](https://tryhorus.com), a full-stack observability system for distributed microservices.
