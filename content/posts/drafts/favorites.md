This is a list of things that I like and recommend across different topics.

## Computing

### How to learn programming

I enthusiastically recommend [Launch School](http://www.launchschool.com), without which I probably would've never become a software engineer.

### Linking

I learn linking while working on a C migration at Thought Machine: migrating from `musl` to `glibc` means changing what C standard library your binary is linked to.

I hope that a good starting point is this article I wrote about [learning how to fix linking errors]({{< relref "/posts/python-decimal-module-performance-optimization.md" >}}).

I learnt a lot through:

- [Computer Systems: An Application Programmer's Perspective](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18724533) and [Computer Organization and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128203315/) are both great at building up the necessary context and introducing linking
- [Beginner's Guide to Linkers](https://www.lurklurk.org/linkers/linkers.html)
- Ian Lance Taylor's [20 part blog post on linkers](https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/)

## My favorite books

My favorite book is any of the biographies written by Robert Caro. He describes the books as about power at a subnational (Robert Moses) and national (Lyndon Johnson) level. While that's true I also think the books are more than that: almost a keyhole into what makes us human.

While I can't choose a favorite book of the 5 (here's hoping he publishes the last volume of LBJ's biography!), I do distinctively have some favorite chapters:

- The introduction of *The Power Broker*, where Caro uses the same literary device to describe Moses' construction as Homer uses to describe the greek ships headed to Troy
- The chapters on the life of LBJ's rival to the senate, Coke R. Stevenson ("Mr Texas"), in *Means of Ascent*
- The chapter on the contradictory Dick Russell in *Master of the Senate*
- The assassination of Kennedy and LBJ's masterful transition of power in *The Passage of Power*

## Movies

My favorite movie is [The Umbrellas of Cherbourg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5KAmPDg8qA). I'm convinved that people who watch it and don't feel anything don't have a heart.

I also like a lot, in no particular order:

- [Gone with the Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2oX0zQA67U) (one of the few movies I distinctively remember crying to)
- [Paris, Texas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e590FeeGCM&ab_channel=JanusFilms)
- [The Shining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S014oGZiSdI&ab_channel=StanleyKubrick)
- [Red River](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLak5PwUzH8&ab_channel=CRITERION)
- [Orpheus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ciOWebRF3Y)

## Music

I've loved music for most of my life. I've listened to some genres more than others at different points of my life (I almost don't recognize my 13 year old hard rock version of myself!) — but classical has been what's been most constant throughout.

My favorite piece of music is probably [Mahler's 9th symphony](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bt4myU47pfLm7HVFHiuJI?si=XAKWFbYEQaqHkECiFspdlw). His last movement never leaves me indifferent.

Some of my playlists I always go back to are:

- [Best of the Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0AzOkM5V9OpH051KHWDkFh?si=03a9d37ec4e24d3c)
- [Mingusanity](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6KN2N0ro7mx9LlWHAre3IT?si=aa5c2530b0754a09) (in honor of the great Charles Mingus)
- [Classical Romanticism](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Zes9DBCSxjcsq8QWdsewK?si=d415012accb7400b) (I have a special place for Bartók, Debussy and Ravel)
- [Classical Modernism](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2z9S5QPmOsVEK8xELuWoEr?si=18979253f2254673)
- [Salsa](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1SlMoDsndiu1Pkh8LpD0ZB?si=21fec2983abe442a)
